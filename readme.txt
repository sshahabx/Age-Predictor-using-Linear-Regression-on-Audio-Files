This project works on a large set of audio files and extracts the relevant 
features out of the data and normalizes the extracted values. And then Using Linear 
regression with age as a target value predicts the age of the testing audio set with a 
mean abs error of 11.93.


Plots the extracted features
Evaluates the model on :
Mean Squared Error 
Mean Absolute Error
R^2
